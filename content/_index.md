# About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="avatar.jpeg" alt="avatar">}}




I'm turning a career full of task and requirements management into one of writing and managing code as a full-stack software developer. 

I love problem solving, friendly debates with colleagues, and clean user interfaces.

One of my interests is in Bitcoin development and learning more about distributed peer-to-peer networks. Since 2017, I've been an observer of and participant in the Bitcoin network. The idea that a peer-to-peer network of computer nodes can create digital scarcity (double-spend problem) continues to fascinate me. Recently I started hosting a full node and experimenting with the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), a layer 2 network facilitating real-time payments.

In my spare time, I like to make up silly songs and play guitar with my son. If I have more spare time, I love doing yoga and eating hot chips.
